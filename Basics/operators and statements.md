# Operators and Statements in JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that provides a wide range of operators and statements for performing various tasks in your code. Understanding these fundamental elements is crucial for writing effective JavaScript programs.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numbers.

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers together.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division (/)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand.
- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare values and return a Boolean result (true or false).

- **Equal (==)**: Checks if two values are equal.
- **Not Equal (!=)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
- **Strict Equal (===)**: Checks if two values are equal without type conversion.
- **Strict Not Equal (!==)**: Checks if two values are not equal without type conversion.
- **Greater Than (>)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- **Less Than (<)**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- **Greater Than or Equal (>=)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- **Less Than or Equal (<=)**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

### Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.

- **AND (&&)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **OR (||)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **NOT (!)**: Returns the opposite of the operand's truthiness.

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables.

- **Assignment (=)**: Assigns a value to a variable.
- **Addition Assignment (+=)**: Adds and assigns the result to a variable.
- **Subtraction Assignment (-=)**: Subtracts and assigns the result to a variable.
- **Multiplication Assignment (*=)**: Multiplies and assigns the result to a variable.
- **Division Assignment (/=)**: Divides and assigns the result to a variable.
- **Modulus Assignment (%=)**: Performs modulus and assigns the result to a variable.

## Statements

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.

- **if Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **else Statement**: Executes a block of code if the `if` condition is false.
- **else if Statement**: Provides an alternative condition to check if the `if` condition is false.
- **switch Statement**: Allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

### Looping Statements

Looping statements enable you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

- **for Loop**: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
- **while Loop**: Repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.
- **do...while Loop**: Repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true, with the condition checked after the loop.
- **for...in Loop**: Iterates over the properties of an object.
- **for...of Loop**: Iterates over iterable objects like arrays and strings.

### Jump Statements

Jump statements allow you to control the flow of your code.

- **break Statement**: Exits a loop or a switch statement.
- **continue Statement**: Skips the current iteration of a loop.
- **return Statement**: Returns a value from a function.
- **throw Statement**: Throws an exception.

Understanding these operators and statements is essential for writing JavaScript code that can perform various tasks and control program flow effectively.
