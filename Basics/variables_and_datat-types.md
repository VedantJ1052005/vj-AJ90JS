## Variables in JS

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that can be manipulated or referenced later in your code. Think of them as named containers for storing information. Here are some key concepts about variables:

### Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the `let`, `const`, or `var` keyword:

- `let`: Used for variables that can be reassigned.
- `const`: Used for variables that should not be reassigned (constant values).
- `var` : Similar to `let`, but has different scoping rules.

Example:
```javascript
let tName = "Vedant";
const age = 18;
