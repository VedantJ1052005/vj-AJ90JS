# What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language used for web development. It allows you to:

- Add interactivity to websites.
- Manipulate web content dynamically.
- Create dynamic web applications.

## Uses in Web Development

JavaScript is essential in web development for:

- **Client-Side Scripting:** It can be embedded directly into HTML and executed by the user's browser to enhance web page functionality.

- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is used to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to update and modify page content.

- **Form Validation:** It ensures data entered by users into web forms is correct before submission.

- **AJAX:** Asynchronous JavaScript and XML allow for seamless data exchange with the server, enabling dynamic updates without reloading the entire page.

- **Web Animation:** JavaScript libraries like jQuery and frameworks like React can create stunning animations.

JavaScript is widely supported by browsers and can be used both on the client-side and server-side, making it a fundamental technology for modern web development.
