# Functions in JavaScript

Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are essential for organizing and reusing code. They allow you to encapsulate a block of code, give it a name, and execute it whenever needed. Here are some key points about functions:

## Declaring a Function

In JavaScript, you can declare a function using the `function` keyword followed by the function's name and a pair of parentheses. You can also specify parameters inside the parentheses.

Example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Calling a Function

To execute a function, you "call" it by using its name followed by parentheses. If the function expects parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses.

Example:
```javascript
greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## Return Values

Functions can return values using the `return` keyword. You can capture the returned value in a variable or use it directly.

Example:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(3, 4);
console.log(result); // Output: 7
```

## Function Expressions

You can also declare functions using function expressions, where you assign an anonymous function to a variable.

Example:
```javascript
const multiply = function (x, y) {
  return x * y;
};
```

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise way to write functions, especially for one-liners. They have a shorter syntax and automatically bind to the surrounding context.

Example:
```javascript
const square = (x) => x * x;
```

## Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function.

Example:
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  const localVar = "I'm a local variable";
  console.log(localVar); // Accessible within the function
}

console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

## Function Invocation

Functions can be invoked in various ways, such as regular invocation, method invocation, constructor invocation, and more.

## Recursion

JavaScript functions can call themselves, allowing for recursive solutions to problems.

These are the basics of working with functions in JavaScript. They enable you to write modular, reusable, and organized code.
